# BEFORE YOU BEGIN

Placing the chicken breasts in the freezer for 15 minutes before trimming them firms them up slightly and makes them easier to halve. If the breasts have tenderloins attached, remove them and reserve them for another use.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place chicken breasts on plate, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 15 minutes. Working with 1 breast at a time, starting on thick side, cut breasts in half horizontally. Using meat pounder, gently pound each cutlet into even 1/4-inch thickness between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Pat dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.

2. Spread flour in shallow dish. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge cutlets in flour, shaking off excess, and return to plate.

3. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add cutlets and cook until lightly golden and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to clean plate.

4. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms, bell pepper, shallot, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook until liquid has evaporated and vegetables begin to brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Add capers and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

5. Add broth and wine and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Cook until slightly thickened and mixture is reduced to 1 1/2 cups (measured with vegetables), 5 to 7 minutes.

6. Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Return chicken and any accumulated juices to pan to heat through, about 1 minute. Transfer chicken to platter and top with vegetables and sauce. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve.
