# WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS

This longtime crowd-pleaser at Italian American restaurants (Italian for “thin cutlet”) features thinly pounded chicken breasts that are lightly dredged in flour, quickly sautéed, and served with a vibrant pan sauce of mushrooms, red bell peppers, garlic, capers, white wine, and chicken broth. For a weeknight for-two version, we used two small boneless, skinless breasts and froze them briefly to firm the meat before slicing each in half horizontally (two cutlets per serving). There’s no aggressive pounding needed here (which tends to shred the meat); some gentle pounding was all that was required to even out the thickness of each cutlet. Since we were only cooking four cutlets, we could cook them at the same time in one pan before building our piquant sauce. To finish the sauce, we turned the heat to low, whisked in the butter, and placed the chicken back in the pan to heat it through (about 1 minute).
