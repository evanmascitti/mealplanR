# INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Cook beef, scallion whites, and pepper in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until meat begins to sizzle in its own fat, about 10 minutes. Stir in chili powder, garlic, and cumin and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

2. Rinse beans. Stir in beans, water, and enchilada sauce and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

3. Divide Fritos evenly among 4 bowls. Top Fritos with chili, followed by Monterey Jack and scallion greens. Serve.
