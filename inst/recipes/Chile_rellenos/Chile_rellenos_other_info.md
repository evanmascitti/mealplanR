# WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS
Traditional chiles rellenos (in English, “stuffed chiles”) are filled with just the right amount of melted cheese and enrobed in a delicate, crispy coating. We used soft, melty Muenster cheese for the filling. Cutting the cheese into cubes rather than long strips made it easier to stuff into the chiles. Most recipes call for roasting and peeling the peppers before stuffing them, but we skipped this step to save time. We simply broiled the peppers to soften them and left their skins on. Instead of a traditional egg white batter, we opted for a batter of flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and beer. For our quick sauce, we relied on pantry staples: chili powder, onion powder, granulated garlic, chicken broth, and tomato sauce
