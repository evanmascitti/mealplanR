INSTRUCTIONS

1. FOR THE SAUCE: Heat oil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chili powder, onion powder, and granulated garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add broth, tomato sauce, adobo sauce, and bay leaf and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook at vigorous simmer until reduced to 2 cups, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in lime juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat, cover, and keep warm. (Discard bay leaf before serving.)

2. FOR THE CHILES: Meanwhile, adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Evenly space poblanos on sheet and broil until skins just begin to blister on first side, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip poblanos and continue to broil until skins are just beginning to blister on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Let poblanos rest on sheet until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Adjust oven temperature to 200 degrees.

3. Peel off any loose skin from poblanos, if desired. Working with 1 poblano at a time, leaving stem intact and starting at top, make 3-inch-long vertical incision down 1 side of chile. Use scissors to cut away interior seed bulb, then use spoon to scoop out and discard bulb and seeds. (Some tearing may occur and is OK.)

4. Place 2 Muenster cubes inside each poblano. Overlap poblano opening and thread with skewer to seal. (Use 1 additional skewer per poblano if necessary.) Allow top of skewer to remain exposed by at least ½ inch for easy removal.

5. Place 1/2 cup flour in shallow dish. Combine remaining 1 cup flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt in medium bowl. Whisk lager into flour mixture until smooth.

6. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and line rack with triple layer of paper towels. Add oil to large Dutch oven until it measures 2 inches deep and heat over medium-high heat to 375 degrees.

7. Working with 3 poblanos at a time, dredge poblanos in flour, shaking gently to remove excess. Holding each poblano by its stem, dunk in batter to evenly coat and then transfer to hot oil. Fry until golden and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes, ­turning frequently for even cooking. Adjust burner, if necessary, to ­maintain oil temperature between 350 and 375 degrees.

8. Transfer fried poblanos to prepared wire rack and let drain for 30 seconds. Season poblanos with salt, remove skewers, and transfer sheet to oven to keep poblanos warm. Return oil to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining poblanos and batter. Serve with sauce.

TO MAKE AHEAD: The poblanos can be broiled, seeded, and stuffed 24 hours in advance. The sauce can be made 2 days in advance and microwaved for 2 minutes until hot just before serving.
