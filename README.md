# mealplanR

I can never think of what to cook. I like cooking, and I am OK at it,
but my mind is like a steel sieve when it comes to remembering what
meals I like to make.

Normally, I make paper shopping lists and once they’re gone, they’re
gone.

This repository will keep my meal plans and shopping lists organized and
allow me to sort, query, and repeat them. For example, I can even
pre-populate a whole week’s worth of meals and just make the same exact
shopping list. This would minimize the amount of time and planning I
need to do when trying to conjure up a week of cooking.

Eventually, I would like to make this into an R package that others
could use to plan their own meals.

Links to recent shopping lists (must access via [GitHub Pages
